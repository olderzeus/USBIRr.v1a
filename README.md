PCB Designs and Schematics

hackaday.com-ir-receiver-v1a 			-		Original design from Hack-A-Day
hackaday.com-ir-receiver-v1.4a			-		Modified design using a TSOP4838 and Surface mount PIC 18F2455


Aims and goals for this project. 

Implement RC6 protocol decoder
Allow user configurable protocols
Implement the serial IO port
Allow configuration to be stored in the EEPROM
Optimise the PCB designs to minimise the use of vias and create a fully surface mount ultra miniature version.
